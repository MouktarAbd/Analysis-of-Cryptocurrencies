# Analysis-of-Cryptocurrencies

In this repository, I will be doing a statistical analysis of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin Cash. The statistical analysis is done on Bitcoin Cash then in another notebook, Markowitz' Portfolio Theory is applied to a portfolio of 9 cryptocurrencies from February 2018 to June 2018. Finally, the last notebook will focus on trying different trading strategies using the results of Twitter sentiment analysis on these cryptocurrencies. I have summarized the results of the study in the pdf file.
